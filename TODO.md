# TODO: Fix Dynamic Rewritten Text in Email Writer App

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create a helper function `_generateRewrittenText` in `input_screen.dart` that applies tone-based transformations to the input text.
- [x] Modify the `_handleRewrite` function to use the dynamic rewritten text instead of the hardcoded mock content.
- [x] Test the app to ensure rewritten text varies based on input and selected tone.
- [x] If needed, refine the transformation logic for better variety.
